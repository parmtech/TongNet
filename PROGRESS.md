# TongNet — Progress Tracker

**Updated:** 2026-10-24  
**Stage:** 0 / requirements and documentation  
**Overall:** Research/planning, not implementation  
**Repo:** `manbir6-ux/TongNet` (private, default branch `main`)

## Actually completed
- [x] Repository existence and edit permissions checked through connected GitHub account.
- [x] Existing placeholder README reviewed.
- [x] Canonical project branding and attribution documented.
- [x] Creator-stated 2015 concept origin and 2026 disclosure documented with evidence caveat.
- [x] Historical conversation FAQ, rules and major security risks recorded.
- [x] 3-hour noncancellable pre-trigger rule documented.
- [x] Receiver 24-hour and sender additional 72-hour windows documented.
- [x] Proposed permanent network reserve rule flagged for legal/security resolution.
- [x] Technical, roadmap, decision, changelog and future-session documents initialised.

## Still NOT done
- [x] Resolve Question 1: **Option B — no sender cancellation after Trigger, even for wrong recipient address** (2026-10-24).
- [ ] Resolve Question 2: lost one-time Authenticator Setup Key during 72-hour enrollment period.
- [ ] Answer remaining key loss, theft, recovery and consent questions (one at a time).
- [ ] Complete prior-art search.
- [ ] Prove a decentralised consensus and finality algorithm.
- [ ] Define TONG economics and whether it is asset-backed.
- [ ] Resolve legal treatment of unclaimed funds and payments.
- [ ] Implement any production code, simulations, mainnet or wallets.
- [ ] Execute tests, threat assessment, audits or live transaction benchmarks.

## Current next question

**Q2:** If the one-time Authenticator Setup Key is lost before the wallet's initial 72-hour activation deadline, does the user get a secure way to regenerate it, or must that wallet expire and the user create another? No decision yet.

## Important blockers
1. Consensus / Byzantine finality / Sybil security not designed.
2. Real-money forfeiture to TongNet Network Reserve cannot responsibly launch without clear owner consent and jurisdiction-specific review.
3. Wallet factor + TOTP alone may fail under phishing or compromised devices; secure challenge signing and independent key separation need research.
4. Real TONG value, reserve obligations and network fee budget unspecified.

## How to keep progress meaningful
- After **each** answer, update DECISIONS, FAQ, PROTOCOL (if needed), NEXT_SESSION, PROGRESS and CHANGELOG; commit.
- Describe each item as `planned`, `proposed`, `implemented`, `tested`, or `audited` with evidence.
- Never mark checkboxes done merely because they appear in documentation.
- Include actual links to code commits and tests once those exist.
